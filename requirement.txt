SmartBank
🌟 Overall Concept

Title: My Mini Bank — Learn. Earn. Spend. A fun digital banking simulator where kids:

Open an account

Earn virtual money through math challenges and quests

Save, spend, and transfer using sound-based “digital payments”

Learn concepts like balance, interest, savings goals, and UPI

Everything is local — data stays in the browser. Each child’s “bank” lives on their device.

🏦 Core Features (Kid-Friendly Banking Simulation)

Account Opening
Learning concept: KYC, basic banking terms, saving goals.

Simple onboarding: choose avatar + name + goal (e.g., “Buy a bicycle: ₹500”)

Kids fill a fun form: name, DOB, choose bank name (“Happy Bank”, “Smart Bank”)

Generates:

Account number (random 8 digits)

UPI ID style (name@happybank)

Initial ₹100 “welcome bonus”

💡 Learning outcome: Kids understand how accounts and IDs work.

Earning Money (Math & Quests)
Learning concept: Work, earning, effort-reward.

Kids earn virtual rupees by completing:

Math mini-games:

Quick addition/subtraction with decimals (bank deposits/withdrawals)

Interest calculation puzzles

Currency conversion (₹ → ₹ + paise)

Daily Quests:

“Calculate interest for 2 months at 5%”

“Balance after spending ₹125 from ₹400?”

💰 Each correct answer = +₹X into account 🎯 Each quest = gamified badge (Banker, Saver, Investor, etc.)

Savings & Interest
Learning concept: Compound interest, saving habits.

A “Savings Goal Tracker” shows progress with a progress bar.

Kids can “Deposit” money into Savings Vault for bonus interest (e.g., 2% weekly).

Interest simulated with setTimeout or a time-based counter.

💡 Learning outcome: Savings grow over time, interest explained visually.

Spending & Payments
Learning concept: Digital payments, budgeting, responsibility.

A Mini Store (toys, snacks, books) lets kids “spend” their money.

Each item has a cost → deducts balance → fun animation of “money flying.”

Budget alerts (“Don’t spend all your savings!”).

Digital Wallet + Transfers (Sound-Based 💸)
Learning concept: UPI, secure transfer, transaction verification.

Each device has:

A Wallet QR + Sound Signature (unique encrypted tone)

When sending money → device emits a short “beep pattern”

Receiving device listens via UserMedia API (mic) → decodes tone → confirms transfer locally.

🔐 No backend — transactions are stored locally (IndexedDB or localStorage).

💡 Learning outcome: Understanding of digital money transfer and trust systems.

Add a “Bank Rank” leaderboard (local only) — “Rising Banker”, “Smart Saver”, etc.
